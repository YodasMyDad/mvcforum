    <p>You are about to install MVC Forum @HttpContext.Current.Application["Version"].ToString(). If this is a first time install the installer assumes you have a few things done already, 
        but if you have installed via the Web Platform Installer then you will be fine to continue.</p>

    <h3>First Time Install Checklist</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have a blank database ready</li>
        <li>Make sure the connection string in the web.config is updated to point to this new database</li>
        <li>Make sure the database user has the correct permissions to create new tables</li>
    </ol>
