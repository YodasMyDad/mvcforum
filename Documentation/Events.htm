<p>MVCForum allows you to handle events that occur during forum activity. These events are provided with MVCForum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Badge Awarded</li>
<li>Post Marked as Solution</li>
<li>New Post</li>
<li>New User</li>
<li>Profile Update</li>
<li>New Vote</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case two events are thrown, a "before" event and an "after" event.</p>
<p>You can add your own code to MVCForum to handle the events.</p>
